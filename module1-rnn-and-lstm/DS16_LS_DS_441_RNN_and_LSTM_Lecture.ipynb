    "\n",

    "$$i_t = \\sigma(W_i \\cdot [h_{t-1},x_t]~+~b_i)$$\n",

    "- If $i_t$'s value is closer to 1.0, then more information from the candidate cell state is retained. \n",

Transformers give seq2seq models the capacity to pay attention to specific portions of the input sequence, the most relevent portion in order to make a prediction. Yes, that's right, humanity has figured out how to convert attention into an algorithm. Next stop, self-awareness! \n",

Although **we will cover the endcoder/decoder framework in a future lesson, transformers are outside the scope of Unit 4**. However, once you learn about LSTMs and encoder/decoder frameworks, you will have all necessary information to then go on and learn about transformers on your own. At that point, the only really new bit you'll be learning is the [**attention mechanism**](https://towardsdatascience.com/intuitive-understanding-of-attention-mechanism-in-deep-learning-6c9482aecf4f). \n",
